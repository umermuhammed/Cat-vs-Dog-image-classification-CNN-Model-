This project involves building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of cats and dogs. Using data augmentation techniques, the model is trained on a dataset of cat and dog images to prevent overfitting and improve generalization. The network architecture consists of multiple convolutional layers with batch normalization, max pooling, and dropout for regularization. The project also includes early stopping to optimize training and achieve better accuracy on unseen test data. The model achieves over 91.24% accuracy and can be further tuned for higher performance.
